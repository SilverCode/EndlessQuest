# About
EndlessQuest is a game about, well, anything. The name refers to my endless quest to create a game, any game,
beyond basic boilerplate code. It represents my C++ version of my attempts for the Android version, InfiniQuest.
Aside from the dream of actually finishing a game, this will also serves to act as a "code portfolio". Being
only 1.5 days old, it is littered with TODO's and bugs, so tread lightly.
